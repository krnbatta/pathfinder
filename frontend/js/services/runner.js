//clear the canvas
//trace all the nodes till now
//create the frontier nodes as per the array of frontier nodes.

//put rectangles that are extra - this includes. removing the frontier nodes as well - only when closing
//when generating/updating - first opened node and then frontier node

//source, destination, expanding, frontier, opened, closed
//source and destination remain untouched
//expanding is current - its color is coming directly.
//frontier - all generating/updating nodes that come between 2 expanding
//opened - all the nodes that are not closed or expanded
//closed - the one that is closed

//source, destination, expanding, closed, opened are mentioned. Only frontier is tricky
