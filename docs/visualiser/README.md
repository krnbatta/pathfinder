The figure above displays the interface of the app. The interface is divided into 3 parts:
- Search Display Window(Center): This window is most important component. It is basically a 2-d WebGL Canvas which visualises the algorithm during the course of its run.
- Event List Panel(Right): This displays information about each node in detail. We can see the list of nodes or events unfolding in this panel as the search progresses.
- UI Controls(Top): These controls provide a lot of freedom to the user to interact with the system and enables the user to visualise and debug flexibly.
